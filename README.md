# AIPO
This repository hosts the resources for the AI Principles Ontology (AIPO).

The background to and process for developing the ontology is described in the paper "An Ontology for Ethical AI Principles".

All figures from the paper are available in the Assets folder.

The ontology itself is available in the AIPO.ttl file in turtle (https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) format.

The Proof of Concept using the OECD AI principles is in the PoC.ttl file.
