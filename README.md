This repository hosts the resources for the AI Principles Ontology (AIPO).

The background to and process for developing the ontology is described in the paper "An Ontology for Ethical AI Principles".

All resources (images etc.) from the paper are available in the Assets folder.

The ontology itself is available in the AIPO.?? file.
